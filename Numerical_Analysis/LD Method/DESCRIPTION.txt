The Lanczos-Dyche(LD) Method:

The goal of this project was to test the performance of the LD Method when compared to existing methods. 

The majority of the code for this project was done in Mathematica, but Python was used for plotting.

The Python_Plots folder contains a collection of plots created throughout the course of this project and the Python_Plotters folder holds some of the code
used to make some of those plots(Not all were included only because of the large number of plots).

The Data_Generator Notebooks contain the bulk of the code and they evolve a simple Schrödinger equation test case using different orders of the LD method and compare them
to the existing RK method and the Pseudo-spectral Fourier method.
