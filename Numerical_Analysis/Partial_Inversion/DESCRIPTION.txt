Partial Inversion:

The goal of this project was to create a partial differential equation solver that would only require an inversion of a section of the grid. This was
done to increase the step size that can be used in binary black hole simulations. This would in turn cause a great increase in speed to these simulations.

The coding for this project was done in Mathematica.

The two Equation Generators create an equation that can be applied to grid points so they may be evolved in time. These equations were then used in the eigenvalue test
notebooks to see if the method did create an increased region of stability(so a larger step size could be used).

When I left working on this project we had decided that it did improve for the Advection equation, but it did not seem to cause a significant speed up for 
the Schrödinger equation. This meant that it would not be useful for binary black hole simulations. However, more testing may be being done to see if there is still
a way this method could be used.
