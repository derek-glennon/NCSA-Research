AAS Final Mass and Spin:

This project was done using Python scripts on the local campus cluster and the Blue Waters Supercomputing System.

The goal of this project was to extract the final mass and spin from eccentric binary black hole simulations.

In order to complete this task, I had to pull specific lines of data from the raw simulation data stored within the cluster. I used the single_extract.py
and multiple_extract.py scripts to do this. The multiple version was used for automating the process for large numbers of simulations. This script also includes
ways to catch various issues I encountered with the data.

The scripts then outputs data files with the values to be plotted.
