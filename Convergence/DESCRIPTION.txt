Convergence:

This project was done using Mathematica and Python.

The goal was to ensure the quality of binary black hole simulations by looking at their phase error.

The two Mathematica Notebooks are used to take the raw data from the simulations and calculate the phase error. The multiple version of the notebook is used for 
automating the process for large amounts of simulations.

The Python script was then used to combine any of the phase error of the simulations into correctly formatted plots.

*** Note about Mathematica Notebooks ***
Since graduating from the University of Illinois I have lost access to Mathematica. I was unable to clean up my Mathematica scripts as well as I would have liked before
graduating so I apologize if they are slightly messy.
